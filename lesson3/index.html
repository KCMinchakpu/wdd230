        <p>The site plan document describes the site name, site purpose, target audience with 
          scenarios, site map with navigation, color scheme and application, typography and usually 
          contains wire-frame sketch of the different views. In this Website, I included the following 
          sections as pages:
        </p>
        <h3>Site Name</h3>
        <p>
          The site name is the simply the name of the organizational site and your proposed domain 
          for the site. Part of this process can be driven by available domain names and 
          established trademarks.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The site purpose provides a statement about the purpose of the website drawing upon the client's 
          functional specifications, the industry, and any fictitious but viable goals that I deem to be 
          reasonable for a local chamber of commerce site. This site purpose attempt to provide scope to the 
          website in describing what services and information the site will provide.
        </p>

        <h3>Target Audience and Scenarios</h3>
        <p>
          This section looks into the purpose and the industry, and what scenarios are relevant to the visitor.
           This site will develop two personas that will links to external site to describe the target 
           audience for the project. This section will also describe the target audience being judicious 
           about the selection of the most plausible demographics. Some visitor demographic information to 
           consider is age, income, education, experience with the topic and family status.
        </p>

        <h3>Site Map</h3>
        <p>
          The site map is typically a sketch of all the pages and references on the site and is derived from 
          the customer's functional specifications.  The hierarchical relationship is illustrated and will 
          drive the site navigation and links. 
        </p>    

        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
        <p>
          The color scheme refers to the carefully selected site colors that reflect the organization's purpose
           and trademark colors. This planning document defines the color scheme through a color palette that 
           labels color style definitions and swatches for site elements. 
        </p>   

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>
          The typography section of this website provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are 
          to be applied. The ultimate goal of typography, regardless of subjective opinions, is to properly 
          communicate. In web design I can work with not only the font family, but also the size, line 
          height and text measure or width.
